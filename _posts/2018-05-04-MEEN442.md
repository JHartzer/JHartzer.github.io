In my graduate course on solid modeling and mechanics, we learned the various 
ways to use 3D engineering CAD software (specifically SolidWorks) to create 
well-designed and well-dimensioned parts. By applying what was already known 
about materials science and mechanics, we dove into the realm of finite element 
analysis and how the software can aid in making determinations for the part. 
  
The class covered many different manufacturing techniques and general rules of 
thumb for making parts that are actually manufacturable using standard 
industrial processes. In this way, we became more familiar with how metal parts
are manipulated, which aided in the design of our own parts. 

For our final project, my team was tasked with designing a flexible pipe riser 
inspection tool with a focus on manufacturability using the methods taught in 
the course. My team developed a design that is almost entirely manufactured 
using bent sheet metal. The design and analysis are outlined in our 
[final report]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/pdf/2018-05-MEEN-632.pdf).
