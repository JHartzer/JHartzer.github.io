During my senior year, I was a founding member of the Texas A&M Shell Eco-marathon competition team. The goal of the urban-concept design competition is the create the most fuel-efficient vehicle that still follows the form of a consumer-style car.

Comprised of 10 senior mechanical engineers, the team was broken down into five subteams: Aerodynamics, Chassis, Electronics, Powertrain, and Steering. I was the team lead for both the Electronics and Steering teams.

Miraculously, this team went from most members (including myself) not knowing what the competition was to a fully functioning car in seven months. The team was not expected to go to competition, let alone successfully compete due to the lack of experience and funding. However, we persevered and defied all expectations by finishing the car, driving to California and actually passing technical inspection. Despite being a first-year team, we were given the safety award for our extensive design work and commitment throughout the competition

Overall this was an amazing experience and has shaped my experience as an engineer.
