Often in robotics research, software is co-developed in multiple programming languages: a scripted language like Matlab for algorithm development, and a compiled language like C++ for deployed code. While scripted languages can initially improve development speed, the need to transfer to a compiled language for performance reasons can lead to costly debugging which increases with system complexity over time. In a new project, EKF-CAL, ROS node code is integrated with a multi-fidelity simulation framework. This framework is presented alongside techniques used to improve the long-term quality of deployed ROS code using unit and Monte Carlo testing.

This presentation was given as [RosCon 2023](https://roscon.ros.org/2023/) with both 
[slides](https://roscon.ros.org/talks/An_Integrated_Modelling_and_Testing_Architecture_for_ROS_Nodes.pdf) 
and a [video](https://vimeo.com/879000742/0d9939e399) recording available online.
