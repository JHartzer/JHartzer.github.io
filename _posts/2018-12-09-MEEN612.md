For my graduate-level Mechanics of Robot Manipulators course, my group and I analyzed a Omron Adept Hornet 565 delta robot. We derived the forward and inverse kinematics, as well as developed both the inertia matrix in joint space and the mass matrix in operational space. Additionally, MatLab and SolidWorks singularity simulations were used to determine the operational space.
