Ciaowdy!

This morning we all woke up at around 7:30 and got a quick snack before heading over to La Pievuccia for a tour of the vineyards from Ricardo. It was very interesting, but not being able to try the wine nearly killed us. This was reflected in both Ricardo, the leaders, and ourselves, but fortunately, we were allowed to smell the wine, which we’ve heard is just as good as drinking it… right? They served us bruschetta, cheese, pizza, foccacia and several other Italian delicacies.

After saying goodbye to the vineyard and snapping a couple thousand selfies, we began the long, but beautiful, walk back uphill to Santa Chiara. Along the way, we passed fields of vibrant sunflowers, fresh corn, and a plethora of mopeds. Once we’d returned, we sat down for another meal of pizza, fruit, some chicken thing we can’t pronounce, and an odd mix of tasty vegetables.

After lunch we had a couple hour break, which some used to nap, while others bonded and explored. Following the break we had a panel of the student leaders who talked about A&M clubs, leadership opportunities, and school wide activities.

Then, Jon and Luke enlightened us on the Renaissance and history in Florence in preparation for our trip tomorrow. Florence is the cradle of the Italian Renaissance and we are super excited to visit the amazing city. Our favorite Italian teacher Rosella stopped by for another lesson on useful phrases we can use here. One of our favorite lessons was learning to say “posso” which means “can I” and then miming out the action of which we don’t know the verb.

She took the lesson right up to dinner time (19:30) in the lunchroom where we were blessed with phenomenal spaghetti, fresh fruit and salad, savory, tender, luscious, tasty, delectable, phenomenal (shoot, we already said that one, but it’s true!), well-cooked, well-seasoned, well-done (but it was more like medium rare) roast beef. Overall… C+. Just kidding. Got you (;

We also had mashed potatoes.

Pursuing dinner like a… It’s really late so we’re running out of analogies and examples… penguin chasing after anchovies in the wild Antarticiaciacian waters, we had another meeting in the theater of dreams to learn about safety on our long journeys to Florence and Rome.

Next (great transition words now), we went to our favorite and only gelato dojo in town, Coco Palm. Directly afterwards, we went to the town’s flag performance in the Piazzo Communale (or Municipale depending on how cool you are) where a vast quantity of humans in Medieval (?) attire (or like the face cards in a card deck) threw flags into the air and then caught them most of the time. The entire ensemble, with drummers, trumpet people, and the royal court made for a great traditional experience.

After that, we realized we were pretty. And tired. And pretty tired pretty people. Which is usually a great time to write a blog. As we returned to Santa Chiara, we began this adventure of writing about our lives on Day 3 of this month of July in the year of two thousand and fifteen. If you’ve made it this far, congratulations and we apologize for having to have read the millions of adjectives and terrible jokes… Which were all serious.

Buona Notte.

Grazie e “Gig Them” (as nobody says)!
