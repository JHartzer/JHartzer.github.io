Ciaowdy!

Today, we traveled to Arezzo! Our train departed at 8:30 and we took the short ten minute ride to the city. There we met Giovanni, our tour guide and stand-up comedian. He took us down the main street from the station, stopping at the Guido Monaco statue, the Basilica di San Francesco, and showing us the architecture and the difference between “real” and “fake” art and architecture. He considered “real” to be made before 1700 and “fake” to be anything made after 1700 in imitation of Roman or Gothic style. He also described his distaste for automobiles, particularly Fiats, because their exhaust destroys the sandstone and their presence ruins his dreams of walking through the street “like a prince.” He demonstrated this by standing in front of a Fiat as it came through the street then jumping out of the way at the last second and saying “Just like that! Fiats pushed hundreds of years of history aside!”

Giovanni was an awesome tour guide, and did a fantastic job of explaining the progression of art in the churches throughout the centuries. We thought it was fascinating seeing all the different styles overlapping each other, such as the varying styles in the stained glass windows and frescoes partially painted or obscured by newer sculptures.

After the church, Giovanni took us to Arezzo’s main park – particularly a spot that overlooked all of the city and had a statue of Petrarch(a famous poet from the 14th century). Then, we went to the Piazza Grande, a square where the city holds a jousting tournament each year. We saw each regions’ flags and coats of arms adorning the surrounding buildings. He showed us a few more small sculptures, then we were free to roam the city (as long as we were in a group of four or more, of course).

Our group wandered down  the street into a small restaurant with our mouths set on finding pizza. Each of us ordered our own pizza, and Travis got a sausage and cheese calzone the size of a large baby. Everything was delicious, and we left the restaurant–after some trouble splitting the bill–with full stomachs and smiles because we FINALLY had had Italian pizza! We wandered around looking in shops that were way out of our price range, and then took a stroll back up to the park. After a short rest, we took a path down to the modern part of the city and got some gelato. By the time we were done, it was time to go back to the train station. We had a rather unorthodox way of returning, but we did arrive to the station first!

After we made our grueling climb back up the hill to the center, we had a session about personal health and wellness led by the student leaders. We moved our session from the breezy courtyard to an oven disguised as a theater (Theater of Dreams, Day 3) to continue our discussion. We got done just in time for dinner: a first course of sausage and mushroom pasta and a second course of vegetables and pork with apple cinnamon stuff, then a desert of ice cream sandwiches! It was all very good. After some down time, we finished the day off with our traditional gelato.

Arrivederci!
