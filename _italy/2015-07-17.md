Ciaowdy!

We woke at crack of dawn (5-ish) and scrambled into our clothes. We quickly made our way down to the train station stopping only to grab a quick breakfast at Il Drago bar. We validated our tickets and found our train. The rolling hills with their many flowers and houses went whizzing by as we made our way to the City of Irises. As we came out of the subway tunnel and into the Piazza di Santa Maria Novella we were awestruck by the sheer magnitude and beauty of the chiesa. We met our lovely tour guide Cecilia and followed her down the streets that begged to be heard as they sang of their rich history. We treaded the same steps that the great Galileo once did and ate in a ristorante that has been a haven for many of the greatest artists, poets and thinkers from the past centuries and to top it all off it was mere steps away from the house Dante was born in. There we were served some of the finest food yet. Tantalizing aromas introduced us to the delicious ravioli and pasta that would soon grace our plates followed with a savory chicken and a side of Italian (French) fries. Not to be forgotten was the sweet, sweet feel of air conditioning washing over us as we walked in, a rare treat in sunny Tuscany. From there we went our separate ways with some of us taking the winding tour up all 463 steps of the Duomo (for the most spectacular view of the city bar none), with others shopping for the finest leathers in all of Italy. As our time drew to a close we doggedly trudged our way back to the station through the convoluted and compact streets of the city (dodging trucks and vespas alike). Not ten minutes after we boarded the train, the early wake up time and ten+ hours of walking took its toll and most of the group succumbed to sleep. Upon our arrival back in Castiglion Fiorentino we made double time back to a waiting dinner. We gladly devoured our pasta salad (with bacon) and limon chicken and a sugary treat that looked like cornbread but tasted like coconut nirvana. After a hurried meeting we hightailed it all the way to the most wonderful Gelateria (the famed Coco Palm) and ordered a plethora of Italian treasures ranging from Cremino to Pistachio and who could forget the Stracciatella. From there we followed the music in search of dancing but ended up participating in a pickup game of Calcio (soccer) with the locals. What started out as a simple game of two-on-two evolved into a friendly full on World Cup with representatives from the U.S. , Italy and even Nigeria. It was a scene of great intensity as everyone strove to be the best on the pitch (even the 7 year olds proved themselves worthy contenders). With feet worn ragged and shirts drenched in the evidence of contest (sweat) we drew our “tournament” to a close and exchanged info with the promise of keeping in contact and a rematch soon.
