Ciaowdy!!

Today was our first full day in Venice. We started our day by having everyone walk to the vaparetto station together to go to Piazza San Marco. The group split in the Doge’s Palace and went at their own pace through the maze of hallways. Some people went to the Opera House for a tour of the beautiful theater. Others shopped for hours on end for everything from glass products to Venetian masks to leather goods. At least one group went to the Guggenheim Modern Art Gallery which featured a special exhibit on the Pollock brothers. Still others enjoyed some well-earned lounge time on the beach on Lido – the island we are staying on just off of Venice.

Venice is a beautiful city of culture, languages, history, and incredible food. The birthplace of tiramisu does not disappoint. However, all of the places we have visited have been incredible examples of the Italian culture and its emphasis on living in the present and enjoying the company of those around you. As student leaders, it has been a privilege to share in that sentiment and enjoy the company of our 36 entering freshmen as they embark on a much larger journey – their time at Texas A&M. Sitting around tables, walking along etruscan walls, and exploring Piazzas all while discussing belief systems, life as a college student and playing raucous games of “Would You Rather?” has served as a testament to the importance of long-lasting relationships while in college. As upperclassmen it is easy to forget the possibilities that the world still holds, but listening to the dreams and ambitions of these kids is a wonderful reminder that the world is still our oyster. We could not be prouder of the 36 kiddos that have been entrusted to our care these past two and a half weeks, and cannot wait to see them take the world by storm during these next few years. (However, we will happily be returning them to you on Friday.)

Grazie per tutto,
