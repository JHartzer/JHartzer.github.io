title: DAY 14- PechaKucha and Goodbyes
order: 2015-07-27

“Today” began a bit later than other field trip days, a sweet relief when our alarms don’t start with a 4 or 5. We took a tour bus to Cortona at 8:30, arriving about 9. We met the eccentric and energetic Giovanni, our tour guide from earlier Arrezo. He led us around several of his home city’s churches, including one that houses the remains of Saint Margherita, Cortona’s unofficial patron saint (don’t tell Saint Mark). The body was a little bit macabre, but the view from the hilltop was breathtaking, as was Giovanni’s savage humor.

After that we entered the city proper, where Giovanni demonstrated the stratum of the city, similar to the others we had visited. However, whereas most of the past cities we went to had Roman, Middle Age, and Renaissance layers, Cortona had a foundation in ancient Etruscan times, and houses existed which integrated Etruscan walls as part of their foundation. (un?)fortunately we couldn’t absorb too much more information, being relatively dead. However, after a brief gelato run, we were a bit more pepped up and wide-eyed and ready…for the ride home. We arrived back at Santa Chiara in time for lunch,

After lunch, we split into groups to panic and attempt to touch up and finish (or start) our Pecha Kucha* projects for a few hours, while several of us began to pack our belongings in preparation for Venice. A few, myself (Mike) included, ventured out to La Bottega Divina to acquire some elusive pecorino al pepperoncino cheese.

Presentations began at 3:30 Santa Chiara time, which is about 3:50 Italy Standard Time. We ran through groups covering a multitude of topics from each of the major cities we visited, and specializations on the art of Florence and on the SC center.

Each presentation was followed by a Q&A, which helped us to understand the presentations further and really reflect on the trip as a whole. After presentations we split up until 6:30, at which time we were given the treat of a harpsichord concert on an instrument constructed by Franco Baruchriarrra and played by his wife Mariela. She played several wonderful pieces included Handel, Bach, and Reumen on the instrument which currently resides in the Santa Chiara theatre. The performance was spectacular, as was the sound of the instrument, and we got to explore and learn about the construction afterwards.

After that, we went to dinner, our last at the center. We thanked the cooks and continued packing for our Tuesday trip to Venice, preparing to say goodbye to the center and turtles for good. We enjoyed a bittersweet gelato trip to the Coco Palm, our last one (for now). We will miss our new Italian home away from home, and I’m sure we all will try to come back one way or another in the future.

Nobody’s dead, everyone’s happy (sorta), and we miss everyone back home in the States!

Ciao!

Michael Fennema and Philip Venesky

No one is safe from Giovanni’s sharp wit, not even Pinky.
