title: Day 8- Walking Through the Art With My Woes

Today was another (relatively) late start with our first activity at 9. A couple groups of people went out to grab breakfast from a cafe near the Piazza Municipale while our heavier sleepers took advantage of the provided pastries at the center. We split into two groups for our activities today: the first group attended a professional development session with our student leaders while the other group showed their artistic flair in a local art studio.

We regrouped for a lunch of a brown rice medley followed by pizza, salad, fruits, and vegetables. We asserted our superiority over the Tennessee and North Carolina groups by claiming the longest table in the dining room, and during lunch put our creativity to use by assigning Harry Potter characters to each and every Ag. Following lunch, many groups took advantage of the short break to research our “tour guide” assignments in Roma e Firenze.

The groups split once again; the two groups switched spots with the first group heading off to their art session while the second group had their individual life-mapping sessions with Luke and Jon. As none of the blog writers tonight are in group two, we will just gloss over what exactly a life-mapping session is. The art, however, was an expression in abstract mono-print. The process involved rolling on a base layer of ink and subtractively designing the plastic plate using tools such as a credit card, porcupine quills, mineral spirits, leaves and brush, just to name a few. On top of this, other colors could be rolled to create contrast and make the designs pop. Once each artist was satisfied, he or she would soak a sheet of paper in water for five to ten minutes (so as to let the ink permeate better). Finally, the artist would press the sheet onto the inked plate to transfer the colors and design.

Once we reconvened at the center and met at the Piazza Municipale, we were treated to a presentation by Mr. E. Lee Walker. After a warm Aggie welcome, Mr. Walker first discussed the presence of a memorial for fallen soldiers in each Italian town in honor of those who sacrificed their lives for others in World War I and World War II. We proceeded back to the center once more and gathered in the courtyard for the remainder of Mr. Walker’s presentation. He thoroughly discussed entrepreneurship and its components, and he also emphasized the vital importance of courage and imagination for success. After his brief presentation, he opened up the floor to a Q&A session that was too lengthy to go into detail in this format. Many students had the chance to personally greet Mr. Walker and grab a quick picture before heading off to a dinner of spiral pasta, chicken parmesan, and chocolate salami in early celebration of Mr. Walker’s and two other students’ (non-Ags) birthdays tomorrow.

After a quick meeting in il teatro, we headed out for our nightly gelato run. Another fantastic day in Italia!

Ciaowdy,

Travis and Christina
