Ciaowdy!

We, the Aggies here in Castiglion-Fiorentino, most humbly apologize for the missing episode in our epic Italian saga. Don’t blame us. We were just a little tired, and believe it or not, we didn’t actually forget to write. It’s just that… nobody did. However, don’t worry because we are back with a vengeance and ready to bring on the greatest belated blog post to date.

Just as a heads up, today was basically yesterday (Day 8) but backwards. Our activities for the day started at 9, giving many an opportunity to either sleep in, catching a few more hours of Z’s, or do as the locals do and start the day with a cappuccino and fresh pastry from the “Bar La Posta”. After breakfast/sleeping in, we had a fabulous time in the morning as we split into two groups; some enjoyed a presentation on professionalism given by our rowdy and “red-ass” student leaders while others headed down to Rick’s art studio to create some truly magical artwork. After we had exhausted this itinerary, many of us decided to nip the ever-present procrastination bug in the bud and get to work on our research presentations for famous sites to see in Rome and Florence. Our research topics included: the Colosseum, Roman Forum, Pitti Palace, Medici Tombs, Pantheon, and Uffizi Museum . After some frantic and totally NOT last minute work on those, a lot of the guys still had time left over before lunch, so around a dozen dudes piled into the ping pong room for a multitude of tournaments, consisting of around-the-world, King of the court, and lots of shouting and grunting. It was very hard work, people. But, as the last rounds of play were coming to an end, the call for food was given and it was time for a delicious lunch supplied by the lovely cooks here at Santa Chiara. Caprese Salad, fried eggplant, melon, prosciutto, and some mixed fruit graced the menu and filled our stomachs.

The afternoon was filled with some brief napping, scattered conversations, and even more competitive ping pong tournaments. All of this, of course, happened between another art class with our awesome instructor Rick and some life-mapping sessions in which we discussed our professional and personal goals for the future with Luke and John.

As evening approached, we all gathered in the courtyard to present our research on historical sites in Rome and Florence. Each of the groups’ presentations went off without a hitch; although, some were a bit more, shall we say, entertaining than others. The Uffizi group, for instance, included some unintentional humor as they went off book, going very deep into the history of one particular painting: “The Birth of Venus”. This, when combined with a few unfortunate mispronunciations, led to a communal laughing frenzy. In any case, once our brains were significantly filled with historical knowledge, we killed more time before dinner by hanging out in the center and in town. The rest of day was fairly straightforward with a delicious (as usual) dinner followed by the perfect end to a great day: GELATO! 😀

Buonanotte,
