Ciaowdy!!

Today we started the last week of our trip by saying ciao to Castiglion Florentino and ciao to Venice. We woke up around around seven in the morning for our last morning at the Santa Chiara center. After packing our bags and bringing them down, we went throughout the city for a final stop at our favorite cafe’s for breakfast. Finally, we departed on a comfy bus on our way to Venice.

The bus ride was about four hours long, which for most of us consisted of sleeping. Though to be fair, many students also used this time to catch up on writing in their journals. Around eleven o’clock we stopped at an autogrill (basically the Italian equivalent of Buckey’s) to enjoy some mediocre food and drink. Then, around 11:30 we got back on the bus and continued our journey. We finally had our first taste of Venice when we caught site of the Adriatic sea. Only a few minutes later we moved our luggage to a small, mostly stable boat and sailed into Venice.

After arriving in Lido, a small island attached to Venice, we quickly found our place of residence, the Hotel Cristallo. The first observation many of us had upon entering was the presence of glorious air conditioning, which was truly a welcome feeling. After getting acquainted with our rooms many of us decided to head out and explore the nearby beach before heading into the main island of Venice.

Once we arrived on the main island, we met up with our tour guide and went around the city. We got to see some of the historically significant sites throughout Venice, including St Mark’s Square and the Doge’s Palace. Seeing the outside of the Doge’s palace certainly got us all excited to see the inside of the palace tomorrow. After the tour, we split up into groups and went throughout the city to eat dinner before meeting back for gelato, which was mediocre at best when compared to the magnificence of Coco Palm.

Ciao
