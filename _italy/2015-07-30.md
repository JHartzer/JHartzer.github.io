Buona Sera Genitori e Amici,

In the famed Beatles song “Hello, Goodbye” the Fab Four use two different English words to express greetings for coming and going, but in informal Italian we can use “ciao” to mean both. This is a nice way to end our experience without really having to say goodbye.

It has been our privilege as trip advisors to share this time with the Italy Fish and to take part in thoughtful discussions with them about their hopes and fears about college and plans for the future. In exploring Italy, we have seen how art and culture have shaped our society and help us understand who we are today. We hope this experience has sparked excitement and intellectual curiosity, and will serve as a torch that will guide these students into the future.

Not only did the Italy Fish learn a lot about themselves, they also grew close to one another, the student leaders, and to us. It was exciting to see the friendships develop. Many students talked about how they plan to stay in contact after the trip, and some were beginning to plan their roommates for next year. We look forward to the newly formed relationships that may last a lifetime.

Today was our last day in Venezia. The weather was overcast which provided relief from the heat we have had for some time.   First thing this morning after a continental breakfast provided at the hotel, many of the group ventured to Murano with anticipation to see the glass blowing factory. After some walking back and forth and a little help from some locals, we finally found the only factory that was could be visited by the public—but it was not open. Some of the students explored further and found artisan glassblowers while others ventured to Cimitero di San Michele, an island used exclusively as a cemetery, for some quiet exploration.

Later, most made their way back to the main island of San Marco. One group visited the Peggy Guggenheim Collection–some could relate to the contemporary art and others had a hard time understanding why it is called art; all were impressed by the graves of her many dogs. Regardless, all were enriched to have at least tasted part of this eclectic art culture. The Guggenheim collection was a far cry from the vast art seen in the many churches, though even in these the students found important differences that demonstrated the development of art over the centuries. Other groups sought out Ciao Bella t-shirts and other gifts, or found time to explore the giardini.

Dinner was at 6:00 p.m. and we were able to celebrate Aaron Rose’s 19th birthday with song and Chocolate Mousse. After dinner the student leaders humbled us with a special recognition of our efforts as trip leaders.

The Italy Fish have had a great opportunity to experience some incredible student leaders. Not only do our student leaders serve as mentors and friends but also as role models on how to succeed in leadership positions on campus and maintain academic excellence. Chloe, Arianne and Reid have been great assets to the program and given the freshmen someone to reach out to for advice. We are greatly appreciative of their efforts and care and attention they have given to the freshmen.

After dinner, some of the groups headed back to Venice for a gondola ride. What a great way to wrap up a wonderful Italian experience! The trip over to San Marco involved some last minute purchases and then back to the Lido by 10:30 p.m. for gelato, the last one as part of this program.

Gondola rush hour

Gelato was good but not as good as the Coco Palm’s. This was the second night for getting gelato at Garbisa’s Bar and Pasticceria. As the last coni was filled with fragola and kiwi, the wind picked up and a rainstorm came through.   We hope it is over by the time we have to take our luggage down the street and load it on the boat.   Now our students are packing and getting their luggage downstairs, a few may be taking short naps before the 3:00 a.m. boat ride to the airport.

A final gelato in Italy

It is our hope that the students have been enriched and at times challenged through this experience. Certainly all of them have grown, and we want to thank the parents for laying the foundation for these incredible students. They are coming home understanding a little better what it means to be embraced by the Aggie Family and to be part of something bigger. It is our hope that some will return someday on a Study Abroad program or as one of the student leaders on this trip. Regardless of how they choose to contribute, we are looking forward to seeing the impact they make on campus!

We will see you at the airport tomorrow afternoon.

Until then…..Ciao, Cao!
