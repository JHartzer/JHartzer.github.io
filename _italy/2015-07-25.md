Today was our free day. Free as in sleep until you wake up, lounge around, eat, and maybe do some laundry. Most of us strolled down to the lobby between 9-10 in the morning (with the latest clocking in at 1:47 PM) and went for a quick breakfast. This being the part of day where we usually get moving to a city, the chance to relax was greatly appreciated by each and every one of us, and we all used it for different purposes. Some decided to rest and catch up on some more Zs, or with the happenings back home via social media. Others decided to get a running start to the day and work on the Pecha Kucha (Pikachu?) project we will be presenting on Monday night, or to catch up on laundry in preparation for the upcoming trip to Venice. Regardless of how each of us spent his or her morning, most of the group met up at Roggi’s for a pizza, or 35 Euro steak, lunch. Others, meanwhile, gathered at Ristorante da Muzzicone to team-tackle the famous 40 oz. Florentine Steak.

After lunch is where the activities of our Ags gets greatly diversified. We had one group of students throw an improv water party in the laundry area, which consisted of a chill talk, soaking feet into a bucket of refeshingly cool water, and spraying each other with with water guns. Another small clan took a hike to Montecchio, a small town and castle a little over 3km from Castiglion Fiorentino. After reaching the town and climbing up more hills (surprise), we totally sieged that castle. Actually, we couldn’t go in, but we did walk around the perimeter and get some great pictures of Castiglion Fiorentino and the Tuscan countryside, including the luckiest lightning shot in the world while a train blazed by. After we claimed Montecchio for TAMU and stopped for some foosball at a local bar, we hiked back to join the rest of the group for our 5:00 sessions.

Leadership and finances were the subjects for today, and they were very practical and informative. Luke and Jon helped us to define leadership and we all contributed what we believed to be characteristics of a good leader. The student leaders jumped in and gave stories that helped us get a better grasp of different styles of leading, and we learned the hard truth that we can’t always please everyone. Overall, the leadership portion of the talk was very productive and helpful to everyone, and we were all super excited to directly address the “leadership” part of “honors leadership seminar.” After a quick question and answer on leadership, we transitioned into Finances, which was basically “You’ll be okay so long as you pay attention to what you do with your money.” And just like that, we were dismissed from the session!

With an hour left until dinner, we were surprised by Rick (the lovely art teacher), who came and set up everyone’s wonderful paintings for an art display worthy of any of the art museums we’ve visited yet.

After a delicious dinner of Torchietti (we looked it up) pasta with meat sauce and a second course of fried chicken and french fries, some of the guys (John, Luis, and Philip) tried their hand at wrestling two time all-state wrestler Jerald Barbe. It didn’t go well for the guys not named Jerald, so we all rewarded our attempts with gelato to finish off a great day!

Ciaowdy,

Valerie and Philip

A fantastic view of Castiglion Fiorentino, and the first strike of lightning that seems to look anything like Harry Potter’s scar.

40 oz Florentine Steak that was a blessing to the Ags that had the wisdom to order it.
