Ciaowdy!

This Sunday, our mornings started with varying degrees of earliness–those so inclined were up and ready to go at 7:30AM to attend mass at a local church in Castiglion Fiorentino, and all were awake by 9:30 to go on a walking tour of the town’s oldest and most interesting sites. With the guidance of a knowledgeable local, we visited the city walls, older and newer churches, the Torre del Cassero, and the ancient ruins of an Etruscan temple. We finished just in time for lunch, which most students enjoyed at the traditional pizzeria Caffe Roggi. The pizza was delicious and everyone left feeling comfortably full.

Today had a more relaxed structure, so students were allowed 2 hours of free time. Most chose to take care of laundry, some napped, and others spent time chatting and writing in their journals. At 2:30, it was time to settle down for our daily Session. We discussed academics and the infinitely important Aggie honor code, as well as the importance of interpersonal relationships, both platonic and romantic. Despite the hot day and many students’ tiredness due to some late nights, it was informative and thought-provoking. We then took part in our personal favorite part of the day, an absolutely delicious cheese-tasting. Our translator, Rossella, guided us through the varieties of cheese and most everyone found a type they liked. Our dinner at the center was fantastic, as per usual, as was our daily gelato.

Though it was by no means uneventful, today was a much-needed and appreciated day of rest. Tomorrow, we take off again for the beautiful and religiously-relevant city of Assisi.

Arrivederci,

Ariel Hayes and Maria Garcia
