title: "Day 13: In Which We Face the Consequences of Our Decisions"
order: 2015-07-26

Today was the day we burgeoning Italy Fish were given a strong dose of freedom: the ability to choose whether we wanted to spend our day in pastoral Orvieto or picture-perfect Perugia, both around an hour away by train. Each of us had different reasons for going to either one of the wonderful cities. Some decided Perugia would be the right choice because of the ability to sleep in (relatively speaking, anyway). While some of us took a “seat of the pants” approach to city selection, others did extensive research on the cities to find out which place would better suit their interests.

We Ags want to give you the full experience, so we have representatives from both towns to fill you in on what happened in each place! Orvieto first: we arrived at the train station at 7:20, despite the train being scheduled to arrive at 7:55 and being a whole 7 minutes late, in order to buy our train tickets and arrive in town in time to explore a little and then attend Sunday mass. After that, we split into groups to eat lunch around town. The local food continued to amaze us as we visited a local craft market, which was bubbling with exciting trinkets, jewelry, and of course, famous Italian leather. After an abundance of great deals and new presents for the folks back home, we explored around town (which basically means walking around and getting lost). We discovered and explored a wealth of old churches and other structures. One of the coolest ones our group found included a vaguely creepy abandoned fountain and a World War I memorial! We wandered through more adorable public parks before accidentally rejoining the rest of the Orvieto Italy Fish inside St. Patrick’s Well. Our group ran into the well on accident and eagerly paid the admission to make the walk down to the bottom of the well. After taking plenty of pictures (and reenacting a scene from the newest batman), we heard familiar voices and we noticed the other Orvieto group joining us at the bottom of the well! We sang a few songs and made some wishes before climbing back up the spiral staircase, boarding the gondola to the train and heading back home.

In Perugia, on the other hand, we visited an ancient tunnel system, took infinite pictures with the beautiful scenery, traversed the medieval aqueducts, and partook in the town’s regionally acclaimed chocolate businesses.  Upon arriving, we were saddened to find out that the acclaimed chocolate factory was closed on Sundays, but luckily we were able to satisfy our tastebuds in the artisan and local chocolate shops located in the main Piazza IV Novembre. Also located there was the famous fountain, Fontana Maggiore, which is a highly acclaimed piece of Gothic architecture in Italy. We were also able to explore highly colorful and unique flea markets where our Ags once again showed off their bargaining skills and eyes for unique and historical beauty. Those of us more interested in the old city tunnels chose to venture underground and found prisons and old stone rooms reminiscent of old bustling city days at the height of the Etruscan empire. We ended off our trip with nice cool gelato at a local artisan shop. On the way down, we rode the amazingly efficient minimetro system that took us by surprise when it  suddenly descended into the dark underground. We returned by train to Castiglion Fiorentino in time to rejoin the rest of the group for the famous “Santa Chiara Diner Dinner,” (we just made that up because it’s 12 am and we’re all tired).

Post-dinner, we mingled until it was time for our daily briefing on tomorrow’s activities. This brought us our first mentions of leaving, which obviously brought out a number of not-so-positive emotions. We were quickly cheered by our nightly gelato, though, and are now all back to work on our projects, which will be presented tomorrow afternoon (wish us luck)!

Grazie e gig ’em,

From the top of the well looking down, WELL before any of us knew what was going on with this piece of medieval beauty (Please forgive us we’re very tired).

The view from when we first got to Orvieto. It was gorgeous, but not nearly as gorgeous as Perugia…. I think.

The long trek was well worth the sight and historical fulfillment. And it totally didn’t look like a “Don’t go into the light” moment.
