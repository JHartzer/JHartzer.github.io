Today marked our second visit to Florence. Excited by the prospect of viewing some of the world’s greatest artistic treasures, most Aggies summoned the energy to hurry down to the Castiglion Fiorentino station for the 6:58 am train. When we arrived in Florence, we headed straight for the Uffizi Gallery, which boasts such famous artists as Botticelli, da Vinci, Caravaggio, Raphael, and Titian. The Uffizi is a massive museum that would take a person countless days to properly view all of the exhibits. But since we only had 20 minutes until our next appointment at the Galileo Museum, we raced through the Uffizi, stopping only for a few seconds in each room to take in the incredible artwork that surrounded us. Even the speediest Ags, however, had to slow down to properly take in Botticelli’s The Birth of Venus, which simply glowed with transcendent life, color and beauty.
After running out of Uffizi, we made a mad dash for the Galileo Museum, arriving breathless and panting just in time to take a walk into the past. We were treated to a wonderful tour, in which we viewed the scientific instruments of the Medici Collection, Lorraine Dynasty, and those of Galileo himself.  It was inspiring to see the very telescopes, astrolabes, maps and physical devices of the great scientists who revolutionized our understanding of the universe.
At the end of the tour, our brains were satisfied, but our bellies were clamoring to be filled! While most Ags wandered off to the different foodie places Firenze has to offer, some of us hit up the famous Mercato Centrale which held a variety of different flavors and styles of food to choose from. The tiramisu offered was delizioso! There was much drooling over Italian leather afterwards as we shopped in Florence’s famous leather markets. We also realized that several Aggies have picked up powerful bargaining skills during our time in Italy!
In the afternoon, we met in front of The Galleria dell’Accademia, which is perhaps most famous for being the home of Michelangelo’s David. After viewing ancient carvings, Byzantine artwork, and Renaissance paintings, we descended upon the greatness that is David.  After staring at the perfect statue in stunned silence, many Ags jumped into action, taking pictures galore.
Our visit to the Accademia was followed by free time in which we wandered the city in search of more history and shopping. Finally, we headed back home to Castiglion Fiorentino for a wonderful dinner and gelato.

A particularly incredible day in bell’Italia, filled with Florentine art, history, fun and friends 🙂

Arrividerci,
