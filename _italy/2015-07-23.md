Ciaowdy!

Day 9 is M.I.A. awkward, not our fault. But to make up for it, here’s the most important picture of the day

Reid at his finest

After getting a chance to sleep in (just kidding, the bus left before 5 AM) we were on our way to Rome! After a quiet bus ride, we walked up to the Colosseum only to hear some rather frustrating and surprising news: the workers on all of the archaeological sights in Rome were on strike! -_-  This meant that the Colosseum, the Roman Forum, and Palatine Hill were ALL CLOSED!!! This hullaballoo led to a fiasco trying to reschedule our reservation to get into these sights. Despite this,  that wasn’t about to strike us out 😉 After taking a few seconds to regroup, we were off to explore Rome and all its wonders.

Because there were so many groups and so much to see, everyone got a chance to see their favorite sights to start the day, including but not limited to: the Basilica di San Giovanni in Laterano, Circus Maximus (which was rated as a 2 out of 10 by a certain Larry Dial), Altare della Patria, the Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain, and the Pincio Gardens.  These are all well-known Roman attractions that a lot of us had an opportunity to see. The Basilica di San Giovanni in Laterano was an incredible architectural feat, and was absolutely gorgeous on the inside.  The Circus Maximus, although not being exactly what some of us had in mind, was still cool to see and walk down, knowing that the path we walked was once used as a race course for chariots in ancient Rome.  The Altare della Patria was well received by all in our group, even though it is notorious among Italians for being “too big and too modern”. The Spanish Steps, as grand and pretty as they were, are just steps. Steps that don’t really lead anywhere. But a little more walking and exploring lead to the Pincio Gardens, which had “debatably” the best view of Rome, making for some great selfie opportunities. Finally, the Trevi Fountain was underwhelming at best :/ Not only is it currently dry, but the view is obscured by various construction materials and a tall plastic shield, making it impossible to toss our lucky coins into the fountain as one Lizzie McGuire once did. But hey, at least we saw it.

After lunch on the go, we reconvened in Piazza Navona, one of Rome’s most popular plazas. We made the long trek, all of 3 blocks, to the Pantheon. We took some exciting group pictures with the A&M flag, then went on inside. The view from the inside was simply stunning, and was appreciated by all.  It made for a great chance to take pictures, and certainly will be remembered by everyone, as it was one of the most historical attractions in all of Rome. From there, most if not everyone ventured to Vatican City to see St. Peter’s Basilica or the Sistine Chapel. Both were magnificent 🙂 St. Peter’s was mind-boggling (s/o to Phil for word choice).  The sculptures, architecture, and general aura of the Basilica left all awestruck. It was a truly incredible experience for those who went. The other option of the Sistine Chapel included a walk-through of the Vatican Museum. There was a lot of beautiful artwork to see along the way, making the wait for the chapel bearable. The Sistine Chapel was the experience of a lifetime, even if we were running short on time. After our Vatican adventure, some of us were able to visit Gianicolo, giving another spectacular view of the entire city of Rome, while others got REALLY adventurous and took a taxi back to our meeting place, the Colosseum.

Once at the Colosseum, after the scheduled strike from 9-12 had ended, we were able to enter this historic structure. The view from the inside of the Colosseum was breathtaking.  Everyone enjoyed walking the floor of the stadium, picturing the gladiators who went to battle in this very structure in ancient times.  Unfortunately, there were no battles today  (although we did see some rather boisterous protesters in the morning, which I guess is the modern day equivalent).  Our last stop of the day was the Roman Forum.  By now, everyone was exhausted from the heat and wary of the thunderstorm in the distance, so although our visit to this storied venue was a bit abrupt, it still provided everyone another chance to picture the bustling lifestyle once hosted by the Forum.

After saying “arriverdercci” to Rome, we stopped at an Autogrill for dinner on our way back to Castiglion-Fiorentino. It got mixed reviews, but at least we got something in our stomachs.  We got off the bus and went immediately to gelato before getting back to the center to get ready for our next adventure tomorrow, our second trip to Florence.

Buona Notte!

All of us still happy outside the Colosseum before we found out about the strike.
