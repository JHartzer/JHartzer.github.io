After a long day of travelling, we finally arrived at Santa Chiara at 2pm today.

We were treated to some unexpectedly hard bread, juice, and cookies before heading to our rooms to unpack. We split up into groups and our tour guides guided us around the town of Castiglion Fiorentino, highlighting Coco Palm (the gelato shop),the ATMs, and some spectacular views. Despite the lack of AC, everything is straight out of a travel magazine. The courtyard is a good place to meet up and mingle and includes three roaming pet tortoises. Dinner, which began at 7:30pm, included a first course of pasta with meat sauce, a second course of salad, chicken, and veggies, and a dessert of fruit. After dinner, we received our first briefing and concluded our 48 hour journey with a generous helping of gelato.

Bouna Notte,

Saul Martinez and Mary Harvey
